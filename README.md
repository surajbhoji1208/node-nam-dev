Node js
    - its a java script run time build on cromes v8 engin 
    -Cross platform- run on different os
    - it is open sourece maintained by openjs
    -it help to run js outside of browser
    -it has event driver architecture 
    -it capable of async io also know as non blocking io

Q: What is a server?
        A server is essentially a remote computer. You can think of it as a computer
        whose CPU works remotely.
        Servers can be accessed over a network to provide resources and services to
        other computer programs.
        A server is a computer or system that provides data, services, resources, or
        programs to other computers, known as clients, over a network.
        Behind the scenes, when a computer needs to communicate with a server, it
        sends a request to the server using its IP address. Initially, JavaScript could only
        be executed within web browsers, limiting its use to client-side tasks. However,
        with the introduction of Node.js, JavaScript can now also be executed on servers,
        allowing developers to use the same language for both client-side and server-side
        programming

Q: What is v8
    -The V8 JavaScript engine is written in C.
   - V8 can be embedded into any C program, which is a crucial feature.
    The process works as follows: JavaScript code is executed by V8 (written in
    C, which then compiles it down to machine code that the computer can
    execute.


            NODEJS is a c++ application with v8 embedded into it
            ECMAScript is a standard for scripting languages, including JavaScript,
            JScript, and ActionScript. It is best known as the standard that defines
            JavaScript.
            ECMAScript standards are followed by JavaScript engines like V8,
            SpiderMonkey, Chakra, and others to ensure consistent behavior across
            different environments.
            so , v8 engines has to follow this ECMA standards. and node.js has v8
            engines, but node.js also has some superpowers, such as api calls on servers,
            which make it more powerful than v8 engines alone, which cannot do
            database connections, api calls, etc. because of ECMA standards. and this is
            known as the JS runtime.
            V8 is C code.
            Ever wonder how your JavaScript code comes to life? ðŸ¤” We write JS, and then
            the V8 engine translates it into machine and assembly codeâ€”also known as lowlevel codeâ€”so the machine can understand it. It's amazing how our high-level
            scripts transform into the instructions that power our apps!
